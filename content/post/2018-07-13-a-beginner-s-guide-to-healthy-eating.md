## Background
After seeing [this meme about myself](https://imgur.com/gqOeFOt) I realized it might be a good time to make some lifestyle changes. I've always been fairly active and of a healthy weight, so I've never seen healthy eating as a pressing issue, but in the pursuit of perfection, I think healthy eating is a good goal to aspire to, if only as a challenge.

One thing I noticed is that my biggest barrier is that *I don't know how to cook, or what to buy*. In fact I find the whole process of even thinking about cooking extemely stressful! It is not that I can't follow simple instructions, but rather, when I try to cook that I don't know the name of a lot of ingredients, I don't know how to find these unknown ingredients, and I don't know the name of recipes that I think would be delicious! (And no, I refuse to try Blue Apron). It is this same anxiety of what to do that causes me to make the same mistakes over and over again in regards to eating. I find myself ordering the same few items everytime I go to restaurants and buying the same few items when I go to the grocery store. It is not so much that healthy eating is too difficult, but rather, I find healthy eating to be too unfamiliar. 

With this framework in mind, this is going to be a two part post. This first post will be my (not so scientific) research in finding the right ingredients for a healthy lifestyle to buy, and to create a definiteve shopping list that I can bring with me when I go grocery shopping. I am under the impression, that if I have the right ingredients around the house for long enough, the cooking will eventually take care of itself. My second post, will include the recipes I end up with, and find interesting and simple enough to maintain in my everyday life.


## The Research

The most informative thing I was able to find was [this wonderful Grub Street article](http://www.grubstreet.com/2018/03/ultimate-conversation-on-healthy-eating-and-nutrition.html) written by [Mark Bittman](http://markbittman.com/) and [David Katz](http://davidkatzmd.com/). Bittman is a popular food author, whereas Katz is a world expert in nutrition at Yale. In the article, he repeated emphasizes the importance of eating *greens, nuts, and legumes*, and names drops a lot of foods. These will make the bulk of my list.

The Bittman, Katz article is congruent with [this infographic from onemedical](https://www.onemedical.com/blog/live-well/healthy-plate/) which recommends filling half your plate with greens and only about a quarter with meat. Bittman & Katz primarily recommended eating fish and seafood instead of meat, but since I don't like seafood as much, I will suplement their recommendations with [chicken as it's better for the environment than beefs (and recommended by Leonardo DiCaprio)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHIrbyd-5yo).

One thing that stands out about the Grub Street article is that Bittman & Katz seem absolutely uninterested to dairy. They don't seem particularly upbeat about yogurt. They don't seem to encourage milk drinking. They simply recommend 1 hardboiled egg a day for a full healthy serving of cholesterol, yogurt if you need a little protein, and that you avoid full-fat dairy. That's it. With this in mind I think eggs and yogurt should be add-on to the list, but not a staple. 

The next most informative website I came across was [Authority Nutrition](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition), which looks like it is no longer updated. The articles on the website however, seem to be a wonderful resource. Authority Nutrition substantiates the Grub Street article, but also adds some tips that are not inherent obvious like from reading the first article like [avoid fruit juices and dried fruits](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/is-fruit-good-or-bad-for-your-health#section7), [you don't need to really worry about eating too much fruit](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/is-fruit-good-or-bad-for-your-health#section7), [olive oil is a better choice than vegetable oils](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/15-health-foods-that-are-really-junk-foods#section13), [and that whole wheat might be bad for you whereas whole grains are probably pretty good (and they are not the same!)](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/15-health-foods-that-are-really-junk-foods#section4). They also seem to rave  about [apples](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-health-benefits-of-apples)  and [bananas](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/bananas-good-or-bad#section9) which wasn't as clear in the original article.

They offer a few more specifics on which [fruits](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/20-healthiest-fruits) and [vegetables](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/14-healthiest-vegetables-on-earth) which I also included in the list.

Lastly, I am not going to blindly buy all my fruits and vegetables in my cart without knowing when they're in season and what to look for.

## Next Steps

After a few weeks of following my own prescribed advice, I've been eating healthier than I ever have in my life. I don't feel all too different, but regardless healthy eating has become a source of confidence for me. With the healthy shopping list in hand, my next step is going to be *laminating my personal copy, and keep it inside of my reusable shopping bag which I always bring with me.* For me, I think this is going to be strong enough of a nudge to keep me purchasing healthier foods for myself. My next step is going to be what can I use these ingredients to cook to make a filling lunch that I can bring to work. I will post an update this post in about 6 months, after suitable experimentation.
