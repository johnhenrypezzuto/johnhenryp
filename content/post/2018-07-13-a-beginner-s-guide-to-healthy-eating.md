## Background
After seeing [this meme about myself](https://imgur.com/gqOeFOt) I sort of realized it might be a good time to make some lifestyle changes. I've always been fairly active and of a healthy weight, so I've never seen healthy eating as a pressing issue, but in the pursuit of perfection, I think healthy eating is a good goal to aspire to, if only as a challenge.

One thing I noticed is that my biggest barrier is that *I don't know how to cook, or what to buy*. In fact I find the whole process of even thinking about cooking extemely stressful! It is not that I can't follow simple instructions, but rather, when I try to cook that I don't know the name of a lot of ingredients, I don't know how to find these unknown ingredients, and I don't know the name of recipes that I think would be delicious! (And no, I refuse to try Blue Apron). It is this same anxiety of what to do that causes me to make the same mistakes over and over again. I find myself ordering the same few items everytime I go to restaurants and buying the same few items when I go to the grocery store. It is not so much that healthy eating is too difficult, but rather, I find healthy eating to be too foreign. 

With this framework in mind, this is going to be a two part post. This first post will be my (not so scientific) research in finding the right ingredients for a healthy lifestyle to buy, and to create a definiteve shopping list that I can bring with me when I go grocery shopping. I am under the impression, that if I have the right ingredients around the house for long enough, the cooking will eventually take care of itself. My second post, will include the recipes I end up with, and find interesting and simple enough to maintain in my everyday life.


## The Research

The most informative thing I was able to find was [this wonderful article](http://www.grubstreet.com/2018/03/ultimate-conversation-on-healthy-eating-and-nutrition.html) written by [Mark Bittman](http://markbittman.com/) and [David Katz](http://davidkatzmd.com/). Bittman is a popular food author, whereas Katz is a world expert in nutrition at Yale. In the article, he repeated emphasizes the importance of eating *greens, nuts, and legumes*, and names drops a lot of foods. These will make the bulk of my list.

The Bittman, Katz article is congruent with [this infographic from onemedical](https://www.onemedical.com/blog/live-well/healthy-plate/) which recommends filling half your plate with greens and only about a quarter with meat. Bittman & Katz primarily recommended eating fish, but since I don't like seafood as much, I will suplement their recommendations with [chicken as it's better for the environment than beefs (and recommended by Leonardo DiCaprio)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHIrbyd-5yo).

Lastly, I am not going to blindly buy all my fruits and vegetables without know when their in season and what to look for.

## Next Steps

With the healthy shopping list in hand, I am going to *laminate my personal copy, and keep it inside of my reusable shopping bag which I always bring with me.* For me, I think this is going to be strong enough of a nudge to help me purchase healthier foods for myself. My next step is going to be what can I use these ingredients to cook. I will update this post in about 6 months, after suitable experimentation.
