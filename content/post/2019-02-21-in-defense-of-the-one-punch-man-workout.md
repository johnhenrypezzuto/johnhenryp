The second season of "One Punch Man" is coming out pretty soon! For those uninitiated, One Punch Man is a Japanese super hero anime making fun of super heroes. The show makes fun plays on the over-the-topness of super heroes but also _the beaurocracy_, _the public relations struggles_ of being a superhero (much like The first Incredibles movie). What sets this show apart is that it also manages to have genuinely cool action scenes, and be laugh out loud funny. Alas, one recurring theme is the main hero Saitama's, amazing fitness, that make's him undefeatable. What's his workout?

100 push-ups. 100 sit-ups. 100 squats. and 10 KM of running. Every single day. In the show he doing this for 3 years and causes Saitama to loses all his hair.

Naturally this has caused [some](https://youtu.be/uX1Nh-xl_yY) to try out, and often they report back that it was a [lame](https://youtu.be/Y2iICRLVkfY) [workout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuqyMspHTmQ), but my guess is that these motivated Youtubers had experience working out before working before starting this work out.


But there is actually a suprizing amount of vitriol against the workout. Tough guy "Genzho" on Roamstrong writes:

> Lol, 100 Push-Ups, Sit-Ups, and Squats wouldn’t even make a seasoned fighter sweat. That’s not even a warmup. The 6.2 miles is the only potentially challenging part of the workout. I’m not even being cocky either. Those numbers are stuff to laugh at for high level athletes.

Quora user Rich Andoh writes in response to "How effective would the One Punch Man workout be?"

> It would be effective at:<br/>
1. creating a imbalance; <br/>
2. getting you nowhere;  
3. traumatising you and your body into everything except good health.

Although both these comments are true for some people, I don't agree with their take-aways. Consider that [only 23% of Americans get enough exercise](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/06/28/cdc-report-only-23-americans-get-enough-exercise/741433002/), and that [men who can do more than 40 push-ups are at lower risk of dying from cardiovascular disease](https://blog.humanos.me/push-ups/). Although I don't pretend that either of those studies offers conclusive evidence on the benefits of exercising, I do probably think most people could benefit from working out more. And if you're the kind of person who enjoys copying the work-out from your favorite super hero, why not?

What I especially like the about the One-Punch-Man workout is that it is unequivocally clear. Unlike a lot of traditional workouts (e.g., chest day, leg day, arms day, rest, repeat) there is never unambiguity about what you should be doing that day. There are is no equipment needed. 

One thing I've been making the counting easier is by using [Runtastic apps](https://www.runtastic.com/en/apps) (no affiliation). These are free apps that count your reps for you on your smart phone. There is one for [running](https://www.runtastic.com/en/apps/runtastic), [push-ups](https://www.runtastic.com/en/apps/pushups), [sit-ups](https://www.runtastic.com/en/apps/situps), and [squats](https://www.runtastic.com/en/apps/squats). One day I would like to try the [pull-up](https://www.runtastic.com/en/apps/pullups) as well, although that would be extra.
