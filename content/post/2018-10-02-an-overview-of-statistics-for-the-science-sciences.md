I found myself deeply inspired by the Edward Tufte tweet where he recommmends adding a warning label to statistical techniques:

<div class="center">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If use of every statistical model was accompanied warnings similar to those accompanying every prescription drug.   In medical research, mistakes in data analysis can shorten 1000s of lives.  <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/biostatistics?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#biostatistics</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/statistics?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#statistics</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/datascience?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#datascience</a> <a href="https://t.co/GhLltkd3NG">pic.twitter.com/GhLltkd3NG</a></p>&mdash; Edward Tufte (@EdwardTufte) <a href="https://twitter.com/EdwardTufte/status/1010912547745263616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 24, 2018</a></blockquote>

I don't know of anything like this that currently exists. But there should be. We know that attention and time are both limited so I think a simple guide that could be helpful to both students and researchers would be enormously helpful. I don't think I am entirely the right person to make such a guide, but I do feel like I know enough to write sizable chunk. So here is my approach. I wrote as much as I could using [Discovering Statistics Using R](https://www.amazon.com/Discovering-Statistics-Using-Andy-Field/dp/1446200469), [The Essential Guide to Effect Sizes](https://www.amazon.com/Essential-Guide-Effect-Sizes-Interpretation/dp/0521142466/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1538503386&sr=1-1&keywords=the+essential+guide+to+effect+sizes&dpID=51ve3-1lhoL&preST=_SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&dpSrc=srch), and [Statistics in Plain English](https://www.amazon.com/Statistics-Plain-English-Third-Timothy/dp/041587291X/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1538503418&sr=1-2&keywords=statistics+in+plain+english+4th+edition) as my sources for writing. If you feel like there have any suggestions or add-ins, I want to hear it because I want this to be a holistic as posible. I making this an open source article, so go ahead and make the change at: https://github.com/johnhenrypezzuto/johnhenryp/blob/master/content/post/2018-10-02-an-overview-of-statistics-for-the-science-sciences.md
