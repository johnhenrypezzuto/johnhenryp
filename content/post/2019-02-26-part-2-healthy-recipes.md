This is a continuation of [Part 1 - A Beginner's Guide to Healthy Eating (Creating a Shopping List)](https://johnhenryp.com/post/a-beginner-s-guide-to-healthy-eating/).

Over the last 6 months or so, I have been cooking _a lot_. I have a reputation in my lab for cooking all my own lunches. My original intent was to exclusively use the ingredients in the aforementioned list. I didn't. However I still think 

Here are the limitations:
* In highsight if I wanted to stay true to the healthy eating list, I think it would've been better to use exclusively vegetarian cookbooks
* I didn't have any kind of food processor or pressure cooker, so I avoided these types of recipes
* I didn't have access to a East Asian or Indian grocery store, so I could only make due with what our local grocery store had
* I am not an experienced cook. Some of the recipes that didn't turn out well were because I wasn't skilled enough to make them

The cookbooks I used are [The Mission Chinese Food Cookbook](https://www.amazon.com/Mission-Chinese-Food-Cookbook/dp/0062243411/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=mission+chinese&qid=1551230956&s=gateway&sr=8-1), [Momofuku](https://www.amazon.com/Momofuku-David-Chang/dp/030745195X/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=momofuku&qid=1551231007&s=gateway&sr=8-1), [Crossroads](https://www.amazon.com/Crossroads-Extraordinary-Recipes-Restaurant-Reinventing/dp/1579656366/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=crossroads+cookbook&qid=1551231029&s=gateway&sr=8-1), [The Food Lab](https://www.amazon.com/Food-Lab-Cooking-Through-Science/dp/0393081087/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+food+lab&qid=1551231042&s=gateway&sr=8-1), [Korean Home Cooking](https://www.amazon.com/Korean-Home-Cooking-Classic-Recipes/dp/1419732404/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=korean+home+cooking&qid=1551231060&s=gateway&sr=8-1), & [Gordan Ramsay's Ultimate Cooking Course](https://www.amazon.com/Gordon-Ramsays-Ultimate-Cookery-Course/dp/1444756699/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3HHLM1G21FO01&keywords=gordon+ramsay+ultimate+cookery+course&qid=1551231077&s=gateway&sprefix=gordan+ramsays+u%2Caps%2C136&sr=8-1).

Hat tip to [Martin F. Manalansan IV](https://globalstudies.illinois.edu/directory/profile/manalans) & [Betsy](http://betsylevypaluck.com) both whom recommended me websites. 


Overall I spent a very long time navigating through grocery lists, cookbooks. I don't know how anyone with a life could reasonably scavenger through so many cookbooks and buy all the esoteric ingredients. Seriously a lot of work. I share my favorites to make it easier for anyone interested in the future:

















I also made a spreadsheet of all the ingredients for all the recipes. It is not inherently interesting, but one kind of cool thing about doing this is that is allows me to count the occurances of ingredients for anyone who would want to know what is most useful:
