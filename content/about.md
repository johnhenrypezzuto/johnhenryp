My name is John-Henry Pezzuto. This is my personal blog where I add things to the internet that I couldn't find otherwise. I am interested in using experimental psychology to analyze the power structures that exist in society. This can involves I wide range of topics including developing understanding how people treat minorities, how politicians maintian their image, and the understanding how people are influenced by the media.
