My name is John-Henry Pezzuto. This is my personal blog where I add things to the internet that I couldnâ€™t find otherwise. I am interested in using experimental psychology to analyze the power structures that exist in society. This can involves a wide range of topics including developing an understanding of how people treat minorities, how politicians maintain their image, and the understanding of how people are influenced by the media.
