      <description>It took me a long time to quit Facebook &amp;ndash; years. I knew that I didn&amp;rsquo;t particularly like most of my Facebook friends. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have particularly pleasurable experiences on the website post-high school, and most of all, I didn&amp;rsquo;t particularly like updating my profile picture. Still I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to delete my page, I had it for years, and Facebook messenger is really helpful.
In some sense I think I felt like the the decision not to delete Facebook was out of my control.</description>

      <title>How to Block Child Comments on Reddit</title>

      <description>In the spirit of digital minimalism, I found that by blocking the child comments on reddit, I find myself scrolling less. The way I did this was by right clicking uBlock Origin, clicking options, and then the &amp;ldquo;my filters&amp;rdquo; tab. I added the following line of code:
 www.reddit.com##.noCtrlF.toggleChildren
 This line stops the the &amp;ldquo;Show Child Comments&amp;rdquo; button from showing up.
Note: I do this in addition to having my RES automatically hide all child comments.</description>

      <title>How to Hide the Cursor on Mac and How to Fix Cursorcerer</title>

      <description>My mac used to hide the cursor by pressing F6 (fn F6 for those uninitiatied). Then one update, I don&amp;rsquo;t know, Apple took that feature out? Anyway the best work around I found thus far was to download Cursorcerer, which is a freeware program which basically offers the same function with a couple extra features.
However, I noticed if I don&amp;rsquo;t use Cursorcerer for awhile it stops working. Because of this, I made an applescript that toggles it on and off which is much faster (and much less annoying) than going to my settings and toggling the Cursorcerer manually.</description>
