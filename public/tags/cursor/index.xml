      <description>My mac used to hide the cursor by pressing F6 (fn F6 for those uninitiatied). Then one update, I don&amp;rsquo;t know, Apple took that feature out? Anyway the best work around I found thus far was to download Cursorcerer, which is a freeware program which basically offers the same function with a couple extra features.
However, I noticed if I don&amp;rsquo;t use Cursorcerer for awhile it stops working. Because of this, I made an applescript that toggles it on and off which is much faster (and much less annoying) than going to my settings and toggling the Cursorcerer manually.</description>
