      <description>Easily the most profound ideas from modern clinical psychology is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). For those unfamiliar, the key tenet of CBT is that if we can change the way we think, then we can change the way we feel. In practice, CBT involves learning to recognize distortions in thinking, and then address these issues with new improved practices. For example, people often use the word &amp;ldquo;should&amp;rdquo; in everyday life. &amp;ldquo;You should focus on school&amp;rdquo;; &amp;ldquo;You shouldn’t eat so much junk food&amp;rdquo;; &amp;ldquo;You should be grateful for this opportunity&amp;rdquo; etc.</description>

      <description>Background After seeing this meme about myself I realized it might be a good time to make some lifestyle changes. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been fairly active and of a healthy weight, so I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen healthy eating as a pressing issue, but in the pursuit of perfection, I think healthy eating is a good goal to aspire to, if only as a challenge.
One thing I noticed is that my biggest barrier is that I don&amp;rsquo;t know how to cook, or what to buy.</description>
