      <description>Background After seeing this meme about myself I sort of realized it might be a good time to make some lifestyle changes. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been fairly active and of a healthy weight, so I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen healthy eating as a pressing issue, but in the pursuit of perfection, I think healthy eating is a good goal to aspire to, if only as a challenge.
One thing I noticed is that my biggest barrier is that I don&amp;rsquo;t know how to cook, or what to buy.</description>
