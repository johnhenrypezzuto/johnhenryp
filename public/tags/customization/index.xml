      <description>@@@ writes that after changed the notification label from blue to red, Facebook saw a dramatic uptick in useage. Red is the color of urgency.
However I&amp;rsquo;m not on Facebook. I am on OSX however, I feel like I check my messages too much. I did experiment turning off my message notifications full stop, but I found I started checking my messages even more out of curiosity. I recently changed my notifications to blue and I feel like this really helped.</description>
