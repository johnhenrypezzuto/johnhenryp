      <description>I made a pretty cool app using Automator for mac that downloads wallpapers from the internet, deletes the old ones, and shuffles the gives me a new image everyday. I based the design off this thread from 2011. It makes me very happy and impressed when I open my computer each day! In this post I am going to walk you through how to make it, and I am going to post screenshots of the final product at the bottom.</description>

      <description>It took me a long time to quit Facebook &amp;ndash; years. I knew that I didn&amp;rsquo;t particularly like most of my Facebook friends. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have particularly pleasurable experiences on the website post high school, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t particularly like updating my profile picture, but still I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to delete my page. I&amp;rsquo;ve had it for years, and Facebook messenger is really helpful. In some sense the decision not to delete Facebook was out of my control.</description>

      <title>How to Block Child Comments on Reddit</title>

      <description>In the spirit of digital minimalism, I found that by blocking the child comments on reddit, I find myself scrolling less. The way I did this was by right clicking uBlock Origin, clicking options, and then the my filters tab. I added the following line of code:
 www.reddit.com##.noCtrlF.toggleChildren
 This line stops the the &amp;ldquo;Show Child Comments&amp;rdquo; button from showing up.
Note: I do this in addition using having my RES automatically hide all child comments.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a long time thinking that if I could learn to read at a faster pace that everything in my life would be better. I could be abunduntly more productive in my research with less time, my knowledge would compound exponentially, and with my newfound freetime I could &amp;ndash; take a break! This is the premise of speed reading courses which offer to double or triple your reading rate with no loss of comprehension.</description>

      <title>How to Hide the Cursor on Mac and How to Fix Cursorcerer</title>

      <description>My mac used to hide the cursor by pressing F6 (fn F6 for those uninitiatied). Then one update, I don&amp;rsquo;t know, Apple took that feature out? Anyway the best work around I found thus far was to download Cursorcerer, which is a freeware program which basically offers the same function with a couple extra features.
However, I noticed if I don&amp;rsquo;t use Cursorcerer for awhile it stops working. Because of this, I made an applescript that toggles it on and off which is much faster (and much less annoying) than going to my settings and toggling the Cursorcerer manually.</description>
