      <description>It took me a long time to quit Facebook &amp;ndash; years. I knew that I didn&amp;rsquo;t particularly like most of my Facebook friends. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have particularly pleasurable experiences on the website post-high school, and most of all, I didn&amp;rsquo;t particularly like updating my profile picture. Still I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to delete my page, I had it for years, and Facebook messenger is really helpful.
In some sense I think I felt like the the decision not to delete Facebook was out of my control.</description>
