      <description>Open science practices are on the rise. However I don’t really think good coding practices are there yet. There are a few really good guides on good workflow practices that I found especially helpful, but I didn’t really find these modern or comprehensive (or entirely focused in R!). This is my attempt at such a guide.
Before going further I do want to emphasize that it makes sense to post data and code to a place like OSF.</description>
