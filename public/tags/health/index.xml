      <description>The second season of &amp;ldquo;One Punch Man&amp;rdquo; is coming out pretty soon! For those uninitiated, One Punch Man is a Japanese super hero anime making fun of super heroes. The show makes fun plays on the over-the-topness of super heroes but also the beaurocracy, the public relations struggles of being a superhero (much like The first Incredibles movie). What sets this show apart is that it also manages to have genuinely cool action scenes, and be laugh out loud funny.</description>

      <description>Background After seeing this meme about myself I realized it might be a good time to make some lifestyle changes. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been fairly active and of a healthy weight, so I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen healthy eating as a pressing issue, but in the pursuit of perfection, I think healthy eating is a good goal to aspire to, if only as a challenge.
One thing I noticed is that my biggest barrier is that I don&amp;rsquo;t know how to cook, or what to buy.</description>
