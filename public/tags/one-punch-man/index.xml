      <description>The second season of &amp;ldquo;One Punch Man&amp;rdquo; is coming out pretty soon! For those uninitiated, One Punch Man is a Japanese super hero anime making fun of super heroes. The show makes fun plays on the over-the-topness of super heroes but also the beaurocracy, the public relations struggles of being a superhero (much like The first Incredibles movie). What sets this show apart is that it also manages to have genuinely cool action scenes, and be laugh out loud funny.</description>
